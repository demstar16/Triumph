# TRIUMPH
Algorithms, Agents and Artificial Intelligence Project
## What is it?
TRIUMPH is a political wargame where you can play as the Resistence opposing the Government, as the Government trying to stop the Resistence 
or you can run a Simulation of the bots versing each other. 
## The Code
The bots are simple rule-based bots that have an uncertainty associated with them and use Bayesian Methods (Baye's Rule) to help them make their decisions.
## How to play?
It's simple...
1. Create virtual environment (or use a pre-existing one).
2. Activate the environment
3. Install "requirements.txt" into the virtual environement  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
4. Run game.py  
```python game.py```
### NOTE: Recommended to be run on a Linux System or Sub-System, purely for styling purposes. The 'colorama' package appears to be more consistent in the Linux environment.
